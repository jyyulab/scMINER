    "content": "Analysis on PBMC(12k) scRNA-seq data via scMINER Here we demonstrate our pipeline using PBMC (10x genmomics) scRNA-seq data [link to data matrix]. Full data contains 68k cells(link to 10x website), in order to provide a quicker guidance, we’ve down sampled this data to 12k cells. Original data website can be downloaded here. Installation scRNA-seq data preprocessing Read 10x genomics data Down sampling Quality control Generate MICA input Run MICA clustering on HPCF Cluster-based network analysis Cell type analysis from MICA output Reading MICA output Marker gene highlighting Assign cell type to cluster Network generation via SJARACNe Find cell type specific master regulator Calculate Inferred activity Find Differential activity TF Cell type specific network profiling Installation scMINER is based on python and R, with a single R package glued all essential functions together. scRNA-seq data preprocessing This can be done by any scRNA-seq preprocessing pipeline. We encourage user to feed in all genes from your data for MICA, instead of highly variable genes only. Here, in order to stick to the focus, we only demonstrate a quick function to conduct gene/cell filtering, without any data exploratory visualization. Read 10x genomics data Read 10x genomics data wih function embeded in scMINER package. d &lt;- readscRNAseqData(file=&quot;PBMC68k_input/&quot;,is.10x = TRUE) Down sampling In order to provide a quicker guidance, we’ve down sampled this data to 12k cells. set.seed(1) d.12k&lt;-d[,sample(colnames(d),12000)] dim(d.12k) #[1] 32738 12000 Quality control d &lt;- pre.MICA (data.input=d.12k, #data matrix that have unique colnames and geneSymbol as rownames output_rmd = TRUE, #whether or not output Rmarkdown report, default as TRUE projectName = &quot;PBMC12K&quot;, gene_filter=TRUE, # do gene filtering cell_filter=TRUE, # do cell filtering cell_percentage=0.005, # gene filtering criteria ERCC_filter=TRUE, # by spike-in Mito_filter=TRUE, # by mitochondra genes UMI_filter=&quot;both&quot;, # by UMI count(three way filtering) plotting=TRUE, # If do visualization plot.dir=&quot;.&quot;, # save plot at.. norm=10e6, # normalize to .. sampleID=&quot;PBMC_12k&quot;, # sample info (could be a string or a vector of original group info) log2Transform=TRUE #if or not do log2 transformation ) If you set plotting = TRUE, then there will be two visualization plot generated for gene/cell quality control. One is the total number of cell expressed by each gene The other plot will visualize total UMI count, total number of gene expressed, mitochondria percentage, and spike-in percentage for each cell. Generate MICA input After reviewing all visualization and conduct filtering, you can go ahead and generate clustering(MICA) input, which will be a cell by gene txt file. If your data was not generated by 10x genomics, you can prepare your own filtering and use this step for clustering Input generation, please note that you should always feed MICA the log or log2 transformed data. generateMICAinput(data=d,filename=&quot;PBMC12k_MICA_input.txt&quot;) This will output a txt file containing filtered expression matrix for MICA. Run MICA clustering on HPCF MICA is implemented in Python now. If you would like to install MICA solely, please infer MICA github page.There are several parameters for you to choose when running MICA. Here we provided is an example of running MICA on high performance clusters.

Cluster-based network analysis MINIE analysis was wrapped up as a R package to help bridge unsupervised clustering and gene regulatory network analysis. Note: Detailed information about individual functions are documented in package manual. Cell type analysis from MICA output First, after clustering via MICA(see [MICA] (/docs/MICA.html), you can load MICA output (in .txt) as well as input expression matrix in R under an expressionSet. This is going to be the major data structure we used for MINIE analysis in R. Reading MICA output eset.demo &lt;- readMICAoutput( input_file=&quot;PBMC12k_MICA_input.txt&quot;, load_clust_label=TRUE, output_file=&quot;PBMC12k.ggplot.txt&quot;) Marker gene highlighting Picked marker genes could be visualized on t-SNE scatterplot, heatmap or violinplot. This will help pick up a reasonable number of cluster. gn.sel&lt;-c(&quot;CD3D&quot;,&quot;CD27&quot;,&quot;IL7R&quot;,&quot;SELL&quot;,&quot;CCR7&quot;,&quot;IL32&quot;,&quot;GZMA&quot;, &quot;GZMK&quot;,&quot;DUSP2&quot;,&quot;CD8A&quot;,&quot;GZMH&quot;,&quot;GZMB&quot;,&quot;CD79A&quot;,&quot;CD79B&quot;,&quot;CD86&quot;,&quot;CD14&quot;) gene_highlighting(input_eset=eset.demo, target = gn.sel, title.size = 8) gene_vlnplot(eset.demo,target=gn.sel,group_tag = &quot;label&quot;) gene_heatmap(eset = eset.demo,target = gn.sel,group_tag = &quot;label&quot;, save_plot = TRUE,width = 6,height = 6, name = &quot;log2_expression&quot;,plot_name=&quot;./GeneHeatmap.png&quot;) Assign cell type to cluster Here we curated a reference signature list of 8 immune cell types(link) for cell type annotation.

And R function generateSJAracneInput will help to partition your expression matrix and conduct a loose filtering of your scRNA-seq data(filter about 0 expressed genes in cluster). Besides, a reference TF list should be provided as tf.ref to guide hub gene selection. Each group will create one directory which contains filtered expression matrix in .exp format, as long as the filtered TF list in .txt. generateSJAracneInput(eset=eset.12k,tf.ref=tf.ref,wd.src=&quot;Sjaracne/&quot;, group_tag=&quot;celltype&quot;) Warning: SJARACNe has not been integrated into MINIE yet, please consult here for installation. indir=~/PBMC12K/SJARACNE_PBMC12K/ for i in $(ls -d */ | cut -f1 -d&#39;/&#39;);do sjaracne ${i} $indir/${i}/*.exp $indir/${i}/tf/*.txt $indir/${i}/tf/ --c_threshold 0.01; echo ${i} has been submitted!; done Find cell type specific master regulator Identify master regulator from content based network is the key step in MINIE to help understanding your scRNA-seq data. Calculate Inferred activity TF acitivities are calculated by integrating expression profile of their targets. Targets identified from SJARACNe of perticular TF was normalized and averaged to infer TF activity. acs.demo &lt;- GetActivityFromSJARANCE( SJaracne_output_path=&quot;Sjaracne/&quot;, SJaracne_input_eset=eset.demo, activity.method=&quot;unweighted&quot;, activity.norm=TRUE, group_tag = &quot;celltype&quot;, save_network_file=FALSE, save_path=NA) Find Differential activity TF The function FindDAG was designed for identify highly differentiated TF from SJARACNe inferred activity matrix. In order to do so, we did two sided student’s t-test to compare mean acitivty from one cell type V.S. the others. res &lt;- FindDAG(eset = acs.demo,group_tag = &quot;celltype&quot;) This function will output a full matrix that contians all TF occurred in original dataset, statistics such as t.statistics, p-value, 95%CI, etc. are outputed to help idenify master regulators. You can save it in txt or xlsx for checking. While you can also visualize top master regulator candidates in heatmap or violinplots. Only png as plotting device is supported. TF_list &lt;- TopMasterRegulator(DAG_result = DAG_result, celltype=levels(acs.12k$celltype), # ensure cluster order n = 5, degree_filter = c(50,500)) gene_heatmap(eset = acs.12k,target = TF_list,group_tag = &quot;celltype&quot;, width = 6,height = 6, save_plot=TRUE, cluster_rows = FALSE, name = &quot;Activity&quot;,plot_name=&quot;./21_TopTFHeatmap.png&quot;) You can also check some known master regulators as postivie control of your network analysis: p &lt;- gene_vlnplot(eset=acs.12k, target=c(&quot;LEF1.TF&quot;,&quot;TCF7.TF&quot;,&quot;BATF.TF&quot;,&quot;TCF7.TF&quot;, &quot;TBX21.TF&quot;,&quot;IRF8.TF&quot;,&quot;SPIB.TF&quot;,&quot;BATF3.TF&quot;,&quot;CEBPA.TF&quot;), ylabel = &quot;Activity&quot;,group_tag = &quot;celltype&quot;,drawquantiles = FALSE, ncol = 2) Cell type specific network profiling rewiring and bubbleplot ## R session info R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23) Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit) Running under: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Matrix products: default BLAS: /System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib locale: [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 attached base packages: [1] parallel stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages: [1] bindrcpp_0.2.2 Biobase_2.42.0 BiocGenerics_0.28.0 dplyr_0.7.8 [5] RColorBrewer_1.1-2 ggplot2_3.1.0 reshape2_1.4.3 loaded via a namespace (and not attached): [1] Rcpp_1.0.0 rstudioapi_0.8 bindr_0.1.1 magrittr_1.5 tidyselect_0.2.5 [6] munsell_0.5.0 colorspace_1.3-2 R6_2.3.0 rlang_0.3.0.1 stringr_1.3.1 [11] plyr_1.8.4 tools_3.5.0 grid_3.5.0 gtable_0.2.0 withr_2.1.2 [16] digest_0.6.18 yaml_2.2.0 lazyeval_0.2.1 assertthat_0.2.0 tibble_1.4.2 [21] crayon_1.3.4 zip_1.0.0 purrr_0.2.5 glue_1.3.0 labeling_0.3 [26] openxlsx_4.1.0 stringi_1.2.4 compiler_3.5.0 pillar_1.3.1 scales_1.0.0 [31] pkgconfig_2.0.2",
