## Demo data
{: .d-inline-block :}

Here we demonstrate our pipeline using PBMC (10x genmomics) scRNA-seq data. Full data contains 68k cells, in order to provide a faster guidance, we've down sampled this data to 12k cells. Original data can be downloaded [here](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/1.1.0/fresh_68k_pbmc_donor_a).

## Step 1: Data preprocessing
{: .d-inline-block :}

### Read 10x genomics data
Read 10x genomics data with function `readscRNAseqData `in scMINER package. This function could help read data from either 10x genomics standard output(usually contains three individual files: matrix.mtx, barcodes.tsv, features.tsv), or other text files by passing arguments to `read.delim()`. 

This function helps create a Sparse matrix object using Expressionset prototype, If set `CreateSparseEset=T`. Otherwise, it will create a list object that stores expression data, feature data and sample data under three separate slots. If `add.meta=T`, then additional sample info such as total number of UMI will be calcualated and outputed in sample data. Here, since data was downsampled and not in standard 10x genomics output format, we defined `is.10x=F`,`CreateSparseEset = F`, and `add.meta=F`.

```R
d.12k <- readscRNAseqData(file="PBMC_demo_input.txt",is.10x = F,CreateSparseEset = F, add.meta=F)
```

After loading data to environment properly, you can now create Sparse Matrix expression by using `CreateSparseEset`function:

```R
eset.12k<-CreateSparseEset(data=d.12k, add.meta = T)
```

### Quality control and data filtering
Quality control assessments could be done using `draw.scRNAseq.QC` function, which outputs a html report generated through Rmarkdown. The report includes three essential quality control figures at both gene and cell level. Suggested cutoff will be returned as a list if set `output.cutoff=TRUE`.

```R
cutoffs <- draw.scRNAseq.QC(SparseEset=eset.12k, 
                          project.name = "PBMC12k",
                          plot.dir = "./QC/",
                          group = "group", # this indicate which meta data information will be use in x axis to group violin plots
                          output.cutoff = TRUE)
```
The first plot is a histogram which helps visualize distribution of expressed genes among each cells. Blue veritcal line shows the recommended cutoff. Genes expressed lower number of cells than threshold should be filtered.

<center><img src="./plots/1_1_Gene_QCmetrics_before_filtering.png" alt="drawing" width="600"></center>

The second plot helps visualize total UMI count, and total number of gene expressed in violin plots. Horizontal blue line indicates suggested high/low cutoffs. Suggested thresholds were computed based on Median Â± 3 * MAD (Maximum absolute deviance). Actual threshold numbers are also printed right above blue lines in green labels.
![](./plots/1_2_Cell_QC_1.png)

The third plot visualizes mitochondrial gene expression percentage, and spike-in genes expression percentage for each cell V.S. total number of UMI in scatter plots. Cells with high percentage of mitochondrial gene expression but low total number of UMI count are often considered as low quality.
![](./plots/1_3_Cell_QC_2.png)


Then you could perform filtering with function `preMICA.filtering`. We recommend to input `cutoffs` using thresholds list which directly outputted from `draw.scRNAseq.QC` functon. You could also manually change cutoffs by re-assign thresholds in `cutoffs` list, e.g. `cutoffs$umi_cf_hi <- Inf` means not doing filtering on outliers caused by high total UMI value.

```R
cutoffs$umi_cf_hi <- Inf  # only filter on low total number of UMI
eset.sel <- preMICA.filtering(SparseEset = eset.12k, cutoffs = cutoffs)
```
 
### Normalization and transformation
In scMINER package, we don't provide methods to perform data normalizaton. You can use your own prefered normalization method. However, **we highly recommend to do CPM and log2 transformation for MICA input**.

```R
norm = 1e6 
exp.norm <- sweep(exprs(eset.sel), 2, norm/unname(Matrix::colSums(exprs(eset.sel))), '*')

# log transformation
# Required for MICA
exp.log2 <- log(exp.norm+1,base=2)

# save as SparseEset
eset.norm <- CreateSparseEset(data=exp.log2, meta.data = pData(eset.sel), feature.data = fData(eset.sel), add.meta = F)
```


## Step 2: Perform clustering analysis via MICA
{: .d-inline-block :}

MICA was implemented in Python. If you would like to install MICA, please refer to [MICA github page](https://github.com/jyyulab/MICA). There are several handlers for you to choose in MICA for better visualization. A more comprehensive tutorial could be found under [Clustering with MICA](./MICA.md) tab . **Here we suggest saving your working directory prior to running MICA**. 

### Generate MICA input and command
After reviewing all visualization and finished filtering, you can go ahead and generate clustering (MICA) input with function `generateMICAinput`. This function takes an expression matrix as input, and outputs a cell by gene .txt file. Please note that **you should always feed MICA the log or log2 transformed data**.

```R
generateMICAinput(data= exp.log2 ,filename="PBMC12k_MICA_input.txt")
```

We also offer a function called `generate_MICA_cmd ` to help write MICA command in a shell script. In order to run MICA on LSF, you need to set `host=lsf`,  define `queue = [your queue]` (required), and `memory` (optional). In `num_cluster`, you can specify a vector of number of K to perform clustering analysis for different number of cluster simultaneously.

```R
generate_MICA_cmd(save_sh_at = "./PBMC12k/",
                  input_file = "./PBMC12k/PBMC12k_MICA_input.txt",
                  project_name = "PBMC12k",
                  num_cluster = c(8,9,10,12,13,14,15),
                  host = "lsf", queue = [your_queue],
                  memory = c(8000, 12000, 16000, 16000),
                  output_path = "./",queue = "standard")
```



## Step 3: Cell type annotation after clustering
{: .d-inline-block :}

### Read MICA output
{: no_toc }

After clustering via MICA, with function `readMICAoutput`, you can load MICA output (in .txt) as well as your input expression matrix in R to an `expressionSet` object. `ExpressionSet` is the major data structure we used for downstream analysis in R.

> **Note: All functions are designed compatible for both expressionSet and SparseExpressionSet** 

Users shall start with one particular MICA membership and study your optimal number of cluster with cell type signatures. By setting `load_clust_label` as TRUE, clustering label will be saved under `eset$label`.

```R
eset.12k <- readMICAoutput(Obj = d.sel, load_clust_label = TRUE, output_file = "MICA/PBMC12k_k8_tsne_ClusterMem.txt")
```

In order to visualize MICA labels or other metadata on tSNE/UMAP coordinates, your can use function `MICAplot`. Users are required to specify `X` and `Y` coordinates in this function. Other meta data could also be visualized by changing `label` handler. This function outputs a ggplot object. 

```R
MICAplot(input_eset = eset.12k,visualize = 'tSNE',X = "X", Y="Y",label = "label",pct = 0.5)
```

### Marker gene visualization 
{: no_toc }

Picked marker genes could be visualized on t-SNE scatterplot, violin plot or heatmap via function `feature_highlighting`, `feature_vlnplot` and `feature_heatmap`. This will not only help cluster annotation, but also identify optimal number of clusters as well.

```R
gn.sel<-c("CD3D","CD27","IL7R","SELL","CCR7","IL32","GZMA",
          "GZMK","DUSP2","CD8A","GZMH","GZMB","CD79A","CD79B","CD86","CD14")

p <- feature_highlighting(input_eset = eset.12k,target = gn.sel,
	ylabel = "log2Exp", x="X",y="Y",title.size = 12)
```

<center><img src="./plots/3_1_gene_highlighting.png" alt="Scatterplot" width="600"></center>

```R
p <- feature_vlnplot(eset.12k,target=gn.sel,feature = "geneSymbol",
group_tag = "label",ncol = 4,ylabel = "log2Exp")
```
<center><img src="./plots/3_2_gene_highlighting_vlnplot.png" alt="violinplot" width="600"></center>


```R
feature_heatmap(eset = eset.12k,target = gn.sel,group_tag = "label",
			 save_plot = TRUE,width = 6,height = 6,
             name = "log2_expression",plot_name="./GeneHeatmap.png")
```
<center><img src="./plots/3_3_Marker_heatmaps.png" alt="heatmaps" width="600"></center>



### Assign cell type to cluster
{: no_toc }

In order to help assign cell types to each cluster in a more systemmatic way, we introduced `marker_bbplot` function. This function calculated cell type scores for each clusters, and visualize scores using bubble plot, with color scale indicates marker score while circle(bubble) stand for sizes. However, this fucntion requires a pre-defined marker gene lists as input, here we curated a list of well-known marker genes of 9 common immune celltypes as `ref`. **Users are required to follow below header format in order to run this function properly**.

```R
ref <- read.xlsx("Immune_signatures.xlsx")
head(ref)
> head(ref)
  celltype markers weight
1   NaiveT    SELL      1
2   NaiveT    CCR7      1
3     Tmem    IL7R      1
4     Tmem    CD27      1
5     Tmem    IL32      1
6     Tmem    GZMA     -1

p<-marker_bbplot(ref=ref,eset=eset.12k)
```
<center><img src="./plots/3_4_MICA_cluster_score.png" alt="Markerbbp" width="600"/></center>



Before diving into network generation section, please assign your celltype as factors in your expression set. **Please do not include "_" in your cell type names since it will cause mis-parsing in later analysis**.

```R
indx<-factor(x=c("NaiveT","Tmem","CD8em","CD8eff","Bcell","NK","DC","Mo"),
				levels=c("NaiveT","Tmem","CD8em","CD8eff","Bcell","NK","DC","Mo"))
eset.12k$celltype <- indx[eset.12k$label]
```


## Step 4: Network generation via SJARACNe
{: no_toc }

### Generate SJARACNe input
Before generating cell type/group/cluster specific network, group information should be stored under `pData([your_expressionSet])`. An R function `generateSJAracneInput` will help to partition input expression matrix and perform essential filtering(filter out 0 expressed genes in cluster) to ensure a reliable network construction. `funcType` is required to specify what kind of network to generate. A reference transcription factor list will be loaded automatically without manual input. However, you do need to define species information for your data using under `ref`.

This function will help create one directory for each group/cell type, containing required input for SJARACNe such as filtered expression matrix in .exp format and filtered TF list in .txt format. 

```R
generateSJARACNeInput(
	eset = eset.12k,funcType = "TF", 
	ref = "hg",  #human
	wd.src = "SJARACNE",  #Output directory
	group_tag = "celltype")
```

### Run SJARACNe

SJARACNe works as a separate module which implemented in python, please consult [here](https://github.com/jyyulab/SJARACNe) for installation and basic usage. We strongly suggest saving your working directory before running SJARACNe. 

Here we provide an example to run SJARACNe for all celltypes/clusters. After SJARACNe was sucessfully completed, you will be able to get one network for each cell and functional type.

```
indir=~/PBMC12K/SJARACNE_PBMC12K/

for i in $(ls -d */ | cut -f1 -d'/');do
sjaracne ${i} $indir/${i}/*.exp $indir/${i}/tf/*.txt $indir/${i}/tf/ --c_threshold 0.01;
echo ${i} has been submitted!;
done
```


## Step 5: Identify cell type specific hidden driver
{: no_toc }

Identify hidden driver from content-based network is the key step in scMINER to help understand your scRNA-seq data, and provide biological insight. 

### Calculate activity
{: no_toc }
Activity calculation is the basis of driver estimation in scMINER. To infer driver activity, expression profile of their targets are intergrated via function `GetActivityFromSJARACNe`. This function takes SJARACNe output path and expression set as input, and return an activity set as well as structured network files if set 	`save_network_files=TRUE`. 

Since scRNA-seq data are extremly sparse and noisy, we strongly recommend to set `activity.method` as `'unweighted'`. 

```R
acs.12k <- GetActivityFromSJARACNe(
    SJARACNe_output_path ="SJARACNE/",
    SJARACNe_input_eset = eset.12k,
    activity.method="unweighted", # we highly recommend using 'unweighted' as activity calculation method
    activity.norm=TRUE, 
    group_tag = "celltype", # which group was used to partition expression profiles
    save_network_file=TRUE, # whether or not save network for each group
    save_path="./networks/") #default as false, but recommended to be TRUE
```


### Driver estimation by differential activity analysis
{: no_toc }

The function `FindDAG` was designed to identify highly differentiated TF from SJARACNe inferred activity matrix. In order to do so, we did two sided student's t-test to compare mean acitivty from one cell type V.S. the others. 

```R
DAG_result <- FindDAG(eset = acs.demo,group_tag = "celltype")
```

This function will output a full matrix that contians all TF occurred in original dataset, statistics such as t.statistics, p-value, 95%CI, etc. are outputed to help idenify hidden drivers. You can save it in txt or xlsx for checking. 

We also offer a function called `TopDriversfromDAG` to help print top drivers in each cell type to console you specified. This function is helpful for downstream analysis.



```R
TF_list <- TopDriversfromDAG(DAG_result = DAG_result,
                              celltype=levels(acs.12k$celltype), # ensure cluster order
                              n = 5, degree_filter = c(50,500))
```


In scMINER, we provide a handful of visualizations to compare driver activity from different cell type/ clusters. Here we demo 2 basic functions: `feature_heatmap` and `feature_vlnplot`. These functions could be used on either expression and activty matrix.

```R
feature_heatmap(eset = acs.12k,target = TF_list,group_tag = "celltype",feature = "geneSymbol",
             width = 6,height = 6, save_plot=TRUE, cluster_rows = FALSE,
             name = "Activity",plot_name="./21_TopTFHeatmap.png")
```
<center><img src="./plots/4_1_TopTFHeatmap.png" alt="Driver heatmap" width="550"></center>

```R
#check postive controls
p <- feature_vlnplot(eset=acs.12k,target=c("LEF1","TCF7","BATF","TCF7","TBX21","IRF8","SPIB","BATF3","CEBPA"), 
						ylabel = "Activity",
						group_tag = "celltype",feature="geneSymbol", ncol = 2)
```
