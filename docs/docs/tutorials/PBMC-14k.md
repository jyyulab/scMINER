# scMINER Guided Analysis on 14k PBMCs from 10x Genomics
This tutorial introduce you scMINER's basic analysis using a PBMC dataset with 10 sorted populations of 2k cells per population [[Zheng et al., 2017](../reference.md#[Zheng et al., 2017])]. We remove CD34+ cells, CD4+ helper T cells, and total CD8+ cytotoxic cells from the dataset because of low sorting purity or a significant overlap with other immune cells based on the sorting strategy, which creates a new dataset with seven known cell types and 14k cells in total. The original dataset is freely available under accession number [SRP073767](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRP073767) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3357167#.YhQNF2RKj6V).


## Data loading and preprocessing

### Read 10x genomics data
We start by reading the downsampled 10x genomics data with function `readscRNAseqData()`. This function reads data from either 10x genomics standard output files (usually contains three individual files: matrix.mtx, barcodes.tsv, features.tsv) or other text files by passing arguments to `read.delim()`. The function creates a `SparseExpressionSet` object adapted from `ExpressionSet` class if set `CreateSparseEset=T`; otherwise, it creates a list object that stores expression data, feature data and sample data under three separate slots. If `add.meta=T`, then additional sample info such as total number of UMI will be calculated and stored in the object. The following command sets `is.10x=T`, `CreateSparseEset = T`, and `add.meta=T`.

To load data from standard 10x genomics files, creating a `SparseEset` directly is recommended.

```R
# Create a SparseExpressionSet object with meta info
pbmc.14k.eset <- readscRNAseqData(file = "./PBMC14k_input/", is.10x = T, CreateSparseEset = T, 
                                  add.meta = T)
```

The following code loads data that are not from standard 10x genomics files.

```R
# Read the data as a data.frame (not create SparseExpressionSet object or add meta info)
pbmc.14k <- readscRNAseqData(file="./PBMC14k_input/PBMC_20k_MICA_input_filter_14k.txt", 
                             is.10x = F, CreateSparseEset = F, add.meta = F, sep='\t')
```

Then a SparseEset object can be created by using `CreateSparseEset()` function.

```R
# Set add.meta=T to run the quality control and store the info in the object
pbmc.14k.eset <- CreateSparseEset(data = t(as.matrix(pbmc.14k)), add.meta = T)

# (Optional) Define your group information. If there is no additional sample info available, 
# just put a character here
pbmc.14k.eset$group <- sapply(strsplit(pbmc.14k.eset$cellName, "-"), "[",2)
```


### Quality control and data filtering
Quality control assessments can be performed using `draw.scRNAseq.QC()` function, which outputs a html report generated through Rmarkdown [PBMC14K_QC_report.html](../htmls/PBMC14k_scRNAseq_QC.html). The report includes three essential quality control figures at both gene and cell levels. Suggested cutoffs will be returned as a list if set `output.cutoff=TRUE`.

```R
cutoffs <- draw.scRNAseq.QC(SparseEset = eset.14k, project.name = "PBMC14k", plot.dir = "./QC/",
                            group = "group", # the meta info to group violin plots
                            output.cutoff = TRUE) # Output suggested cutoffs
```

The histogram plot visualizes a distribution of expressed genes among each cells. The blue vertical line shows the recommended cutoff (0.5% * number of cells) to filter lowly expressed cells.

![QC_histogram_plot](../images/1_1_Gene_QCmetrics_before_filtering.png)

The violin plot visualizes the total UMI count and the total number of genes expressed in violin plots. Horizontal blue line indicates suggested high/low cutoffs. Suggested thresholds were computed based on Median Â± 3 * MAD (maximum absolute deviance). Suggested threshold numbers are also printed right above blue lines in labels.

![QC_violin_plot](../images/1_2_Cell_QC_1.png)

The scatter plot shows mitochondrial gene expression percentage, and spike-in genes expression percentage (if spike-in genes exist) for each cell vs. the total number of UMIs. Cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial gene expression but a low total number of UMI counts are often considered as low quality cells (above the horizontal line).

![QC_mito_plot](../images/1_3_Cell_QC_2.png)

We recommend using the thresholds in `cutoffs` list returned by `draw.scRNAseq.QC()` function. However, users can adjust the thresholds manually, e.g., `cutoffs$umi_cf_hi <- Inf` will not filter on outliers caused by a high total UMI values.

```R
# Perform the actual filtering
pbmc.14k.eset.filter <- preMICA.filtering(SparseEset = pbmc.14k.eset, cutoffs = cutoffs) 
```


### Normalization and transformation
We recommend count per million reads (CPM) normalization and log2 transformation (required) for performing MICA clustering analysis.

```R
norm = 1e6 
exp.norm <- sweep(exprs(pbmc.14k.eset.filter), 2, 
                  norm/unname(Matrix::colSums(exprs(pbmc.14k.eset.filter))), '*')

# log transformation (required by MICA)
exp.log2 <- log(exp.norm + 1, base = 2)

# save as SparseEset
pbmc.14k.eset.log2 <- CreateSparseEset(data = exp.log2, meta.data = pData(pbmc.14k.eset.filter), 
                                       feature.data = fData(pbmc.14k.eset.filter), add.meta = F)
```


## Perform clustering analysis via MICA
After reviewing all the QC plots and finishing filtering, it is ready to perform clustering analysis. MICA is implemented in Python as a standalone command line tool. Thus we suggest saving your working directory and R session prior to running MICA.


### Generate MICA input
`generateMICAinput()` function takes a log transformed expression matrix as input, and outputs a cell by gene matrix stored in .h5 (default) or .txt file as input to MICA.

```R
# Prepare MICA input
generateMICAinput(d = exp.log2 , filename = "./PBMC14k_MICA_input.h5ad")

# (optional) Clean working environment
rm(exp.log2)
rm(exp.norm)
```


### Run MICA from the command line 
Pick a MICA command to run in a command line environment based on the number of cells of your dataset. For dataset with less than `5k` cells, MICA MDS mode is recommended.

```bash
mica mds -i ./PBMC14k_MICA_input.h5ad -o ./outputs -pn PBMC14k -nc 8 9 10 -dk 14 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```

Here, `-pn` specifies a project name for naming the output files; `-nc` is an array of integers delimited by a single space, where each integer specifies a `k` to perform a k-mean clustering; `-dk` can be an integer or an array of integers delimited by a single space (default is `19`), it specifies the number of dimensions used in k-mean clusterings. Use `mica mds -h` to see more options of MICA MDS mode.

For datasets with more than `5k` cells, MICA GE mode is recommended.

```bash
mica ge -i ./PBMC14k_MICA_input.h5ad -o ./outputs -ar 4.0 -nw 10 -nnm 100 -pdm 3.0
```

Here, `-ar` determines the maximum size of the communities (default: 3.0); `-nw` specifies the number of workers to run in parallel (default: 10); `-nnm` is the number of neighbors to build mutual information-based nearest neighbor graph (default 100); `-pdm` stands for pruning degree multiplier, the vertex with degree greater than pruning_degree_multi * num_neighbors_mi will be pruned. Use `mica ge -h` to find more options of MICA MDS mode.

A more detailed description of important parameters can be found in [API]() page.


### Read MICA output
Function `readMICAoutput()` adds MICA clustering results to the `SparseEset` object created before, which will be the major data structure for downstream analysis. **Note: All the functions for downstream analysis are compatible with both `expressionSet` and `SparseExpressionSet`**. 

After choosing a clustering result based on known cell type signatures or silhouette scores (provided by GE mode). The clustering labels can be saved to `eset$ClusterRes` by setting `load_ClusterRes` as TRUE.

```R
# Load clustering results
pbmc.14k.eset.log2 <- readMICAoutput(eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, load_ClusterRes = TRUE, 
                                     output_file = "MICA/clustering_UMAP_euclidean_24_1.82212.txt")
```
Note in `clustering_UMAP_euclidean_24_1.82212.txt`, `24` is the number of reduced dimensions, `1.82212` is the resolution used for Louvain clustering.

`MICAplot()` function can be used to visualize MICA clustering results using `ggplot`.

```R
# X, Y, color_by specify coordinate and clustering label entries in the eset phenoData; 
# pct is the size of the point
MICAplot(input_eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, X = "X", Y = "Y", color_by = "ClusterRes", pct = 0.5)
```

## Cell type annotation after clustering

### Marker gene visualization
To help with identifing the optimal number of clusters and annotating the clusters, selected marker genes can be visualized with UMAP/t-SNE scatterplots, violin plots or heatmap plots via function `feature_highlighting()`, `feature_vlnplot()` and `feature_heatmap()` respectively.

```R
genes_of_interest <-c("CD3D", "CD27", "IL7R", "SELL", "CCR7", "IL32", "GZMA", "GZMK", "DUSP2", 
                      "CD8A", "GZMH", "GZMB", "CD79A", "CD79B", "CD86", "CD14")

# UMAP scatter plot
feature_highlighting(input_eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, target = genes_of_interest, 
                     feature = "geneSymbol", ylabel = "log2Exp", x = "X", y = "Y", pct.size = 0.5)
```

![PBMC_14k_UMAP](../images/markers_UMAP.png)

```R
# Violoin plot
feature_vlnplot(input_eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, target = genes_of_interest, 
                feature = "geneSymbol", group_by = "ClusterRes", ylabel = "log2Exp", ncol = 4)
```

![PBMC_14k_violin](../images/markers_violin.png)


```R
# Heatmap plot
feature_heatmap(input_eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, target = genes_of_interest, group_name = "ClusterRes",
                save_plot = FALSE, width = 6, height = 6, name = "log2Exp")
```

![PBMC_14k_violin](../images/markers_heatmap.png)


### Cell type annotation
With a pre-defined marker gene list, `marker_bbplot()` function calculates a cell type signature score (weighted mean using the given weights in the marker list) for each cluster, and visualize all the signature scores using a bubble plot. Here, we curated a list of well-known marker genes of 9 common immune cell types and use these genes to calculate a marker score for each of the predicted PBMC clusters. **Note: the pre-defined marker gene list has a required format. See `head(makers)` below**.

```R
# Read marker genes from an excel file
markers <- read.xlsx("Immune_signatures.xlsx")

# Maker gene file has 3 required columns
head(markers)
  celltype markers weight
1 Monocyte    CD14      1
2 Monocyte  FCGR3A      1
3 Monocyte  FCGR3B      1
4 Monocyte   PTPRC      1
5 Monocyte  S100A8      1
6 Monocyte  S100A9      1

# Draw a bubble plot
draw.marker.bbp(ref = markers, input_eset = pbmc.14k.eset.log2, width = 6, height = 4, 
                feature = "geneSymbol", group_name = "ClusterRes", save_plot = FALSE)
```

![PBMC_14k_violin](../images/signature_score.png)


Before diving into network generation section, assign the annotated cell types as factors in your expression set for keeping the current order of the clusters in following visualizations. **Please do not include "_" in your cell type names as it would cause mis-parsing in the following analysis.**.

```R
indx <- factor(x=c("Monocyte", "CD8NaiveCTL", "NK", "Bcell", "CD4TReg", "CD4TCM", "CD4NaiveT"),
              levels=c("Monocyte", "CD8NaiveCTL", "NK", "Bcell", "CD4TReg", "CD4TCM", "CD4NaiveT"))
pbmc.14k.eset.log2$celltype <- indx[pbmc.14k.eset.log2$ClusterRes]
```


## Network generation via SJARACNe
### Generate SJARACNe input
`generateSJAracneInput()` functions uses the annotated cell type information stored in `pData([your_expressionSet])` to generate inputs for running SJARACNe from the command line. The function partitions the input expression matrix and performs essential filtering (filter out not expressed genes in a cluster) to ensure a reliable network construction. `funcType` is required to specify the type of the network. If set `funcType="TF"`, a reference transcription factor list will be loaded automatically without manual input. However, you do need to define species information for your data using under `ref`.

This function creates one directory containing the required inputs (filtered expression matrix in .exp format and filtered TF list in .txt format) for each cell type. 

```R
generateSJARACNeInput(
	input_eset = eset, funcType = "TF", 
	ref = "hg",  #human
	wd.src = "SJARACNe",  #Output directory
	group_tag = "celltype")
```

### Run SJARACNe from the command line 
SJARACNe works as a separate module which was implemented in python and C++, refer to [SJARACNe](https://github.com/jyyulab/SJARACNe) github page for installation and basic usage. Please save your working directory before running SJARACNe. 

Here we provide an example to print SJARACNe commands for IBM LSF platform.  

```
indir = ./SJARACNe
cd $indir
for i in $(ls -d */ | cut -f1 -d'/'); do
echo sjaracne lsf -j $indir/config_cwlexec.json -e $indir/${i}/*.exp -g $indir/${i}/tf/*.txt -n 100 -o $indir/${i}/tf -pc 0.01;
done
```


## Identify cell-type-specific hidden drivers via MINIE
Identify hidden driver from content-based network is the key step in scMINER to help understand your scRNA-seq data, and provide biological insight. 

### Calculate activity
Activity calculation is the basis of driver estimation in scMINER. To infer driver activity, expression profile of their targets are intergrated via function `GetActivityFromSJARACNe`. This function takes SJARACNe output path and expression set as input, and return an activity set as well as structured network files if set `save_network_files=TRUE`. **Please note that this function could only work if you used `generateSJARACNeInput` to create SJARACNe input directory and files.**

Since scRNA-seq data are extremly sparse and noisy, please set `activity.method` as `'unweighted'`. 

```R
acs.14k <- GetActivityFromSJARACNe(
    SJARACNe_output_path ="SJARACNE/",
    SJARACNe_input_eset = eset,
    activity.method="unweighted", # we highly recommend using 'unweighted' as activity calculation method
    activity.norm=TRUE, 
    group_tag = "celltype", # which group was used to partition expression profiles
    save_network_file=TRUE, # whether or not save network for each group
    save_path="./networks/") #default as false, but recommended to be TRUE
```


### Driver estimation by differential activity analysis
The function `get.DA` was designed to perform differnetial activity analysis from SJARACNe inferred activity matrix. In this function, two-sided student's t-test will be performed to compare mean activity from one cell type V.S. the others. It will return a data frame that includes all TF occurred in original data. Statistics such as t.statistics, p-value, 95%CI, etc. are outputed to help identify hidden drivers. You can save it to file in order to check them manually. 

```R
DAG_result <- get.DA(input_eset = acs.14k,group_tag = "celltype")
```

We also offer a function called `get.Topdrivers` to help picking top drivers for each cell type. You can specify `n` as maximum number of top drivers to pick, and `degree_filter` to restrict number of targets. 

```R
TF_list <-get.Topdrivers(DAG_result = DAG_result,
                             celltype = levels(acs.14k$celltype), # ensure cluster order
                             n = 5, degree_filter = c(50,600))
```


In scMINER, we provide a handful of visualizations to compare driver activity from different cell type/clusters. Here we demo two basic functions: `feature_heatmap` and `feature_vlnplot`. These functions could be used on either expression and activity matrix.

```R
feature_heatmap(input_eset = acs.14k, target = TF_list, group_tag = "celltype",feature = "geneSymbol",
                width = 6,height = 6, save_plot=TRUE, cluster_rows = FALSE,
                name = "Activity",plot_name="./21_TopTFHeatmap.png")
```

```R
#check postive controls
p<-feature_vlnplot(input_eset = acs.14k,feature = "geneSymbol",target=c("LEF1","TCF7","BATF","TBX21","IRF8","SPIB","BATF3","CEBPA"),
                    ylabel = "Activity",group_by = "celltype", ncol=2)
```
