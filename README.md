# scMINER (Single-cell Mutual Information based Network Engineering Ranger)
*scMINER* is an R package for preprocessing, QC, clustering, and *hidden driver analysis* of single-cell RNA-seq data. scMINER enables mutual information-based cell clustering, cell-type-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) reverse engineering and protein activity inference, to identify hidden transcriptional factors (TFs) and signaling factors (SIGs) driving cellular lineage differentiation and tissue specific specification. scMINER software consists of three components: [MICA](https://github.com/jyyulab/MICA) (Mutual Information based Clustering analysis), [SJARACNe](https://github.com/jyyulab/SJARACNe) and [MINIE](https://github.com/jyyulab/scMINER/).
