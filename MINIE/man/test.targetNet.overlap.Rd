\title{Test for the target genes' intersection between two drivers.}
\usage{
test.targetNet.overlap(source1_label = NULL, source2_label = NULL,
  target1 = NULL, target2 = NULL, total_possible_target = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{source1_label}{character, the label for the first driver.}

\item{source2_label}{character, the label for the second driver.}

\item{target1}{a vector of characters, the list of target genes for the first driver.}

\item{target2}{a vector of characters, the list of target genes for the second driver.}

\item{total_possible_target}{numeric or a vector of characters. If input numeric, will be the total number of possible targets.
If input a vector of characters, will be the background list of all possible target genes.}
}
\value{
Return the statistics of testing, including the \code{P.Value}, \code{Odds_Ratio} and \code{Intersected_Nuumber}.
}
\description{
\code{test.targetNet.overlap} will test whether the target genes of two drivers are significantly intersected.
}
\details{
This is a function to perform Fisher's Exact Test for the intersection of the target genes from two drivers.
